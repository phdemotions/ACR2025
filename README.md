## Short Abstract
Across three experiments using Moral Foundations Theory, we found that consumers respond more negatively to AI-generated music than human-created music. Specifically, perceived song quality and the moral dimension of purity mediate the negative effect of AI on purchase intentions, while fairness and authority do not play a significant role.

## Long Abstract

The impact of AI has extended its influence beyond the automation of manufacturing products and empowered customer service (Ooi et al., 2025). AI applications such as Midjourney and OpenAI’s DALL·E have transformed the art and entertainment creation space. Due to the relatively recent emergence of these AI applications, researchers have yet to fully explore this disruptive phenomenon. In particular, the underlying mechanisms that explain why consumers express negative perceptions toward AI-created art remain under-investigated. 

Previous research has shown that consumers have difficulties differentiating between AI versus human art when the creation source is unknown (Bhardwaj et al., 2024; Gangadharbatla, 2022; van Hees et al., 2024). However, when they know the art is AI-generated, its appeal is lowered across multiple dimensions (Horton et al., 2023; Zhou & Kawabata, 2023). This negative bias is pronounced among individuals who view creativity as uniquely human (Millet et al., 2023). 

While existing research has examined negative evaluations of AI art, the role of morality has received limited attention. To fill this gap, we investigate the impact of AI-created art on consumer response by using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) (Haidt & Joseph, 2004). MFT identifies five foundations of moral judgment: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and purity/degradation. Research by Newman and Bloom (2012) found that performance (artist’s creative effort) and contagion (physical connection to the art) significantly determine artwork value. Since performance is crucial to artistic evaluation, we posit that fairness and authority influence purchase intentions, as efforts shared with AI may be perceived as cheating or subversive. Additionally, we believe perceptions of contamination would negatively affect product evaluations through a contagion effect.

Our research aims to address three research questions: 

1. How do consumers respond to AI versus human-created art?

2. What factors might moderate the effect of AI use on purchase intention (i.e., instrumental vs. lyrics, Figure 1; male artist vs. female artist; solo artist vs. band)?

3. What underlying mechanisms drive the AI effect on consumer response through the lens of Moral Foundations Theory (i.e., fairness, authority, and purity, Figure 1)? 

### Study 1

We employed a 2 (creator: AI vs. human) × 2 (music type: instrumental vs. lyrics) between-subjects design with 317 participants from CloudResearch (48.90% women; M age = 36.65). Participants were randomly assigned to an AI (n = 158) or human (n = 159) creator vignette, then experienced an instrumental track (n = 158) or lyrics (n = 159). We measured perceived song quality, purchase intention, and moral perception constructs based on the Moral Foundations Questionnaire: purity (Cronbach’s α = 0.98), fairness (α = 0.95), and authority (α = 0.98). 

An independent samples t-test revealed significantly lower purchase intentions for AI-music (M = 2.53) versus human-music (M = 3.04), t(315) = -2.84, p = .005, Cohen’s d = -0.32. A two-way ANOVA showed a significant main effect of the creator, F(1, 313) = 7.83, p = .005, indicating purchase intention is significantly lower for AI versus human-music. However, neither the main effect of music type nor the interaction was significant.

Mediation analysis (Hayes, 2022) showed that perceived song quality and purity significantly mediated the relationship between creator and purchase intention, while fairness and authority did not. This indicated that AI-music is perceived as less pure and of lower quality, leading to reduced purchase intentions.

### Study 2 

We expanded to a 2 (creator) × 2 (music type) × 2 (artist gender) design with 491 participants (49.90% women; Mage = 40.80). A t-test again showed significantly lower purchase intention for AI-generated music (M = 2.49) versus human-created music (M = 3.04), t(485.08) = -3.75, p < .001, d = -0.34. A three-way ANOVA revealed significant main effects of creator and artist gender, with human- music and male artists generating higher purchase intentions. No significant interactions were observed.

In this study, we refined our measurement of purity through factor analysis, identifying three distinct dimensions: Purity/Authenticity (approach-oriented, α = 0.96), Contamination (avoidance-oriented, α = 0.95), and Spirituality (α = 0.81). Moderated mediation analysis showed that perceived song quality predicted purchase intention. The indirect effect of creator through perceived song quality was significant for AI-music but not for human-music. Additionally, spirituality emerged as a significant mediator, with a stronger effect on human-music. These results suggest perceptions of spiritual connection significantly influence consumer responses to AI-music.

### Study 3 

We employed a 2 (creator) × 2 (music type) × 2 (structure: solo artist vs. band) design with 500 participants (49.60% women; Mage = 41.06). We again found lower purchase intention for AI (M = 2.53) versus human-music (M = 2.90), t(497.63) = -2.62, p = .009, d = -0.23. A three-way ANOVA showed significant main effects for creator and music type, with human-created and instrumental music generating higher purchase intentions. A significant interaction of creator and music type indicated that the effect of creator on purchase intention depended on whether the music was instrumental or lyrics-based.

Moderated mediation analysis revealed that perceived song quality (b = 0.70, p < .001) and spirituality (b = 0.30, p < .001) significantly predicted purchase intention, while fairness, authority, authenticity, and contamination did not. The indirect effect through perceived song quality was significant for instrumental music by a solo artist but weakened for lyrical music by a band.

### Conclusion 

Across three studies, we consistently found that AI-generated music leads to lower purchase intentions than human-created music. Our research reveals that, while perceived song quality is the strongest predictor of purchase intention, moral factors—particularly purity—play crucial roles in influencing consumer response. The distinction between approach-oriented purity (authenticity) and avoidance-oriented purity (contamination) provides insight into how consumers evaluate AI-created art. Moreover, spirituality emerged as a distinct influential factor, suggesting consumers associate human-created art with transcendent qualities lacking in AI-art. These findings highlight psychological barriers to AI adoption in music consumption, emphasizing spiritual connection as a critical driver of consumer decision-making of artistic works. While AI may create technically proficient art, consumers still value the perceived purity associated with human creativity.
